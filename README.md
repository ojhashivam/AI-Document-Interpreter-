This project presents Samast, an AI-powered document search application built using the Streamlit framework. Samast enables users to upload PDF documents, input queries, and receive relevant responses extracted from the documents. Leveraging OpenAI's language model and embeddings, Samast provides an intuitive interface for efficient document search and retrieval. The methodology involves preprocessing PDF documents, generating embeddings, and performing similarity search to retrieve relevant information. The paper discusses the implementation details, demonstrates the application's functionality, and highlights potential use cases and future directions.
